# calendar-in-react
A simple implementation of a calendar in React

This is a small exercise to display a calendar panel with year and month
input and support for parsing and updating of the URL. I added an option
to select individual days because it seemed logical.

## Structure

The basic layout is generated by create-react-app. The main App.render()
method sets up the header and a React BrowserRouter instance with a single
route for the calendar.
